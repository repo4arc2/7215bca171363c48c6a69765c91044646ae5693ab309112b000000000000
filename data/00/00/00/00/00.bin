freshly squeezed orange juice,
and black coffee?

17
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,542
I say, "Oh, I don't eat food."

00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,879
Well, that explains
the empty refrigerator.

-Wanda?
-WANDA: Hmm?

20
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,052
Is there something special about today?

00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,638
Well, I know the apron
is a bit much, dear,

22

but I am doing my best to blend in.

00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,391
No, no, there on the calendar.

24
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,062
Someone's drawn a little heart
right above today's date.

25
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,065
-Oh, yes, the heart.
-Hmm...

26
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,276
Well, don't tell me
you have forgotten, Vis.

27
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,402
"Forgotten"?

28
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,988
Oh, Wanda, I'm incapable of forgetfulness.
I remember everything.

29
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,659
That's not an exaggeration.
In fact, I'm incapable of exaggeration.

30
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,703
Well, then tell me what's so important
about today's date.

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,040
What was the question again?

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,334
Oh, well,
perhaps, you've forgotten yourself.

33
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,212
Me? Heavens, no.
I've been so looking forward to it.

As have I.

I haven't.

Hello, dear.
I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.

My right, not yours.

Forgive me for not stopping by sooner
to welcome you to the block.

how's your bridge game, hon?

Golly, you settled in fast!

62

Did you use a moving company?

63
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,345

Oh, no, I'm not single.

Oh, I don't see a ring.

68

Well, I assure you I'm married.

To a man. A human one and tall.

70

As a matter of fact, he'll be home
later tonight for a special occasion.

Not a birthday.

Well, today isn't a holiday, is it?

75

No, it's not a holiday.

For your special night.

88

A young thing like you
doesn't have to do much,

what Ralph could really use

is, "How To Goose Your Wife
So You Don't Lose Your Wife."

In terms of distraction from work,

106
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,620
or the largely nonsensical
nature of the lyrics?

-Ah, no, thank you, Norm.

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

Would you be so good as to tell me
what it is we do here exactly?

No and no.

Then what is the purpose of this company?

All I know is, since you've gotten here,
productivity has gone up 300%.

Yes, but what is it we're producing?

Computational forms.

quite like you do, pal.

Yes, I should hope so.

-for the new hires.
-Ah.

140
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,416
Jones over there failed miserably.

141
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,750
Isn't that right, Jones?

142
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,420
The wife thought
five courses would be sufficient.

143
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,381
And there was that paltry excuse
for entertainment.

144
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,466
A string quartet?

145
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,262
And then you had that embarrassing display
of beatnik enthusiasm.

146
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,722
I wore a turtleneck.

147
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,851
Yes. Best of luck out there
in the unemployment line, Jones.

You know, I owe my success
to being a keen judge of character.

No skeletons in your closet, eh, Vision?

150

I don't have a skeleton, sir.

(CHUCKLES) Of course, you do.

160
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,976
Just out of curiosity, what does it say?

161
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,606
That you should stumble when
you walk into a room so he can catch you.

162
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,066
It's romantic.

163
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,734
Any other tricks?

164
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,780
You could point out that the death rate of
single men is twice that of married men.

165
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,533
Now, that's romantic.

166
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,576

-Wanda, darling.
-Vision, sweetheart.

00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,670
Listen, about tonight...

172
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,131
Don't worry, dear.
I have everything under control.

173
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,675
Oh, well, that is a relief.

174
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,261
I must confess, I'm really rather nervous.

175
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,429
"Nervous"? Whatever for?

176
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,015
Well, you know, darling,
I still get a little tongue-tied.

177
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,687
Vis, after all this time...

178
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,772
There's an awful lot
riding on this one, Wanda.

179
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,652
If tonight doesn't go just so,
I think this could be the end.

180
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,906
Well, it's just one night.
There's no need to get dramatic.

181
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,826
Look, I think the best course of action
is to impress the wife.

182
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,997
And I think the best course of action
is to impress the husband.

183

00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,042
Glad to know we're both on the same page.

185
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,627
Until tonight, then, my, darling.

186
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,920
Until tonight.

00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,347
Is your husband tired of you
burning his toast?

Say, this machine has some shine.

You said it.

193
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,070
Set the dial
and get the taste back into your toast.

How very atmospheric!

203
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,530
What's going on here, Vision?
You blow a fuse?

204
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,325
Pardon me while I just go and fetch
the lady of the house.

Ah...

00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,632
What is the meaning of this?

211
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,843
(STAMMERING) Well, what is...

212
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,261
Yeah, what is the meaning of...

213
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,387
Oh, the meaning of it!

214
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,806
You want to know the meaning of it
and the meaning of it

215
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:26,311
is that this is the traditional
Sokovian greeting of hospitality.

216
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,189
-Guess who?
-Is that my host behind me?

217
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,399
It certainly is.

-Lovely to make your acquaintance.
-Yes! (CHUCKLES)

219

See, I forgot to tell you
my wife is from Europe.

00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,240
Oh, how exotic!

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,269

I'm not going to tell you!

is my boss, Mr. Hart!

but right now...

-Exactly.

So I said, "If we orient the forms
horizontally rather than vertically,

But the larger purpose of the forms is...

Was to analyze our input and our output.

259
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,709
if I didn't have a gourmet meal for four
just lying about the place?

-(LAUGHS)
-Well...

261
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,421
Not that Ralph ever wants to eat
anything but baked beans

262
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,424

about his personal appeal, mind you.

00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,058
Yes, it's her pet name for me.

318
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,309
(SIGHS)

319
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,229
I'm just coming, Fred.

320
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,190
Excuse me a moment.

321
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,237
(GASPS) Oh, no.

322
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,323
How can I be of assistance?

323
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,910
Well, the chicken is no longer a chicken
and the lobsters just flew the coop

324
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,620
so the steak is the last man standing.

325
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,291
It says here I can cut down the prep time
with a meat tenderizer.

326
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,543
Excellent plan. Where's the tenderizer?

327
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,336
-I'm looking at him.
-Ah.

328
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,462
Hoo-hoo in there!

329
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,339
WANDA: (GASPS) Hoo-hoo back to you!

330
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,841
Okay.

331
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,636
Finish the meat, find the lobsters.
I'll be right back.

332
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,556
I hope you're hungry.

333
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,891
Starved, is more like it.

334
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,393
My head is starting to feel woozy.

335
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,439
Were either of you aware

336
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,859
that married men are killing single men
at an alarming rate?

337
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,612
-What are you going on about?
-(LOUD THUD)

338
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,905
And what's going on in there?

339
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,532
Whoo-hoo! Ho-ho! (GASPS)

340
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,159
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

341
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,369
Who could that be?

342
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,205
Coming!

343
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,208
Oh, you didn't answer the back door.

344
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,918
For your upside-down cake.

345
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,920
Oh! Hi, I...

346
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,004
Who was that?

347
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,589
-A salesman!
-Telegram!

348
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,466
A man selling telegrams.

349
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,635
Wouldn't you know it.
Good news is more expensive.

350
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,680
I couldn't find the lobsters and did you
want the meat tender or pulverized?

351
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,932
Oh, dear.

352
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,603
Well. I think tonight's going swimmingly.

353
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,523
Anyone for Parcheesi?

354
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:05,567
-My head is spinning.
-Oh, Mrs. Hart...

355
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,028
Did you hear that?
My wife's head is spinning.

356
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,322
Generally speaking,
I don't like her head to do that.

357
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,742
Time to improvise.

358
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,413
You know, I'm beginning to think
you're not management material, Vision.

359
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,123
You know, I had high hopes for you.

360
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,836
But from what I've seen here tonight,
you can barely keep it together.

361
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,922
I mean, look around. There's all this
chaos going on in your household.

362
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,383
Now, when are we gonna eat?

363
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,051
Dinner is served.

364
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,428
VISION: Ah!

365
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,265
Breakfast for dinner?

366
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,767
How very...

367
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,185
European.

368
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,522
Ooh! Let's have a toast!

369
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,484
To my lovely and talented wife.

370
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,862
To our esteemed guests.

371
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,321
Yes. <i>Cin cin.</i>

372
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,406
Cheers.

373
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,535
Well, please eat before it gets cold.

374
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,495
-MRS. HART: Hmm?
-Oh, Mrs. Hart, allow me.

375
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,416
So, where did you two move from?

376
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,126
What brought you here?

377
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,504
How long have you been married?
And why don't you have children yet?

378
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:16,722
I think what my wife means to say
is that we moved from...

379
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,515
Yes, we moved from...

380
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,435
And we were married...

381
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,229
Yes, yes, we were married in...

382
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,358
Well? Moved from where? Married when?

383
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,484
Now, patience, Arthur.

384
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,778
They're setting up their story.
Let them tell it.

385
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,363
We...

386
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,240
Our story... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

387
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,577
Yes, what exactly is your story?

388
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,537
Oh, just leave the poor kids alone.

389
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,041
No, really, I mean,
I think it's a perfectly simple question.

390
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,959
Honestly.

391
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,252
Why did you come here?

392
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:49,963
Why?

393
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,550
Damn it, why? Why did you...

394
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,261
(CHOKING)

395
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,973
Oh, Arthur, stop it.

396
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,354
Stop it. (CHUCKLES)

397
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,231
Stop it.

398
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,315
(CHOKING)

399
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,319
-MRS. HART: Stop it. Stop it.
-(MR. HART CONTINUES CHOKING)

400
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,739
Stop it. (CHUCKLES)

401
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,199
Stop it.

402
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,118
Stop it.

403
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,245
Stop it.

404
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,538
(GROANS)

405
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,541
Stop it. Stop it.

406
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:26,667
Stop it.

407
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:28,836
Stop it.

408
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:29,962
Vision, help him.

409
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,888
(COUGHING)

410
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:45,978
Let me help you up.

411
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,479
Give me your hand.

412
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,566
All right, steady on, sir.

413
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,735
(GASPING)

414
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,240
Well, would you look
at the time? (CHUCKLES)

415
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,784
Yes. We'd better be going.

416
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,162
Well... Are you both all right?

417
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,332
We had such a lovely time.

418
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,086
This guest is leaving your home.

419
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,671
(LAUGHS)

420
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,923
Yes, thank you for coming. (CHUCKLES)

421
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,009
(SIGHS)

422
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,552
You made me proud tonight, son.

423
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,430
First thing Monday morning,
you and me are gonna have a little chat.

424
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,641
We'll see about that promotion.

425
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,893
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

426
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,563
MR. HART: Thank you.

427
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,318
Oh...

428
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,905
What a charming door knocker.

429
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,449
Good night!

430
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,371
(BOTH EXHALE IN RELIEF)

431
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,707
(SIGHS)

432
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,962
We are an unusual couple, ya know?

433
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,923
Oh, I don't think
that was ever in question.

434
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,761
Well, what I mean is...
We don't have an anniversary.

435
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,554
-Huh.
-Or a song.

436
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,681
Or even wedding rings.

437
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,141
Well, we could remedy that.

438
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,310
Today could be our anniversary.

439
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,979
Of what? Surviving our first dinner party?

440
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,524
Precisely. And our song could be?

441
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,900
<i>Yakety Yak, </i>naturally.

442
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,984
-Naturally.
-Hmm.

443
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:18,654
And the rings?

444
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,532
Well, couldn't you make some for us?

445
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,707
I do.

446
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,793
Do you?

447
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,213
Yes. I do.

448
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,883
And they lived happily ever after.
